\usage{
\method{print}{bHP}(x, type = "bHP", trend_hist = TRUE,
  select_trend_hist = c(1), Head = FALSE, Tail = FALSE,
  print_type = "text", digit = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class 'bHP'}

\item{type}{a character string that specifies what style of print. Default choose is "bHP" showing designed table of class 'bHP'; choose "generic default" if you want to show the result of generic function plot.}

\item{trend_hist}{logical; if TRUE, adding trend component after each HP-filter conduction into the table and call 'select_trend_hist' to choose which iteration; if FALSE, don't add trend conponent history to the table.}

\item{select_trend_hist}{a numeric vector choosing which iteration time to show in the trend component history. It is valid only when 'trend_hist' is TRUE.}

\item{Head}{logical; if TRUE, showing the head of the table; if FALSE and 'Tail' is TRUE, showing the tail of the table; if FALSE and 'Tail' is FALSE, showing the full-length of the table.}

\item{Tail}{logical; if TRUE, showing the tail of the table; if FALSE and 'Head' is TRUE, showing the head of the table; if FALSE and 'Head' is FALSE, showing the full-length of the table.}

\item{print_type}{a character vector that specifies what type of output the command should produce. The possible values are "text" (default) for ASCII text output, "latex" for LaTeX code, "html" for HTML/CSS code.}

\item{digit}{controls the number of significant digits to print when printing numeric values. It is a suggestion only. Valid values are 1...22 with default 8. See the note in 'print.default' about values greater than 15.}
}
\value{
Table showing the content of bHP, "text" (default) for ASCII text output, "latex" for LaTeX code, "html" for HTML/CSS code.
}
\description{
table of the bHP, in text (ASCII text output), latex (LaTeX code) or html (HTML/CSS code).
