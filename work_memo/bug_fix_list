2.add"data()".

3.Make the output list of the main function as an R object with a name, say bHP.

4.Require the input x be a ts object, so that we can keep the time series information and attach it onto the returned cycle and residual.

5.R runs on many generic methods, for example plot and residuals. In our case, we can use residuals to extract the cyclical component.

6. predict to extract the trend component.

7. plot to display the graph of the raw time series and the estimated trend.

8.Find a method to track the path of the p-value of ADF or the value of BIC.
